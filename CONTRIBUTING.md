In order to contribute, pick an issue by commenting it and then wait for me to assign you.
After that, fork the repository and download it. Create a new fork with the issue's name and work in that branch.

When you've fixed selected issue, make a pull request where you add the issue name in the comments, and also comment what you have done with the code.
