This is a copy of a simple project I made during my JS course last year. The task was to create a webpage without any inherent purpose, except for the joy of visiting it and interact with it. It's nothing special, albeit a bit surreal, but has got some small issues that would be nice if they were tended to.

The deployed app:

# Installation

Everything, including images and sound effects, are sorted in a system below the root. Clone or download the repo, and the it's pretty strightforward to run it on a local host with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VsCode, or similar.
